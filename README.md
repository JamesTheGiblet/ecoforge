## üåø Overview

EcoForge is a browser-based ecosystem simulation that demonstrates fundamental ecological principles through an interactive visual environment. Watch as species evolve, compete for resources, form complex food webs, and adapt to changing environmental conditions.

### Core Classes

#### Species Class
```javascript
class Species {
    constructor(id, type, color, x, y) {
        this.id = id;
        this.type = type;        // 'producer', 'herbivore', 'carnivore'
        this.color = color;      // Visual representation
        this.x = x;              // Position
        this.y = y;
        this.size = 4-6;         // Physical size
        this.speed = 0.5-2;      // Movement capability
        this.energy = 100;       // Life energy
        this.age = 0;            // Lifespan tracking
        this.vision = 0-80;      // Detection range
        this.reproductionRate = 0.01-0.02;
        this.diet = type-based;  // Feeding preferences
    }
}
```

#### Plant Class (Producers)
```javascript
class Plant {
    constructor() {
        this.x = randomPosition();
        this.y = randomPosition();
        this.size = 3-6;
        this.color = '#4cd964';
        this.energy = 50;
    }
}
```

## üî¨ Scientific Foundations

### Ecological Principles Modeled

#### Population Ecology
- **Exponential Growth**: Unlimited resource scenarios
- **Logistic Growth**: Resource-limited population curves
- **Carrying Capacity**: Environmental limits on populations
- **Competitive Exclusion**: Species competing for identical resources

#### Evolutionary Biology
- **Natural Selection**: Differential survival and reproduction
